In the last project, you performed k-means clustering on the Enron characters using their financial data as inputs. We’ll update that work to include scaled features, to see how that changes things.

Look back to the last part of the K-Means Clustering Mini-Project. We deployed scaling there without going into the details of the scaling algorithm, but now you know much more about specific scaling algorithms and can diagnose what kind of scaling we were using.

What type of scaling was deployed?

Apply feature scaling to your k-means clustering code from the last lesson, on the “salary” and “exercised_stock_options” features (use only these two features). What would be the rescaled value of a "salary" feature that had an original value of $200,000, and an "exercised_stock_options" feature of $1 million? (Be sure to represent these numbers as floats, not integers!)

One could argue about whether rescaling the financial data is strictly necessary, perhaps we want to keep the information that a $100,000 salary and $40,000,000 in stock options are dramatically different quantities. What if we wanted to cluster based on “from_messages” (the number of email messages sent from a particular email account) and “salary”? Would feature scaling be unnecessary in this case, or critical?
